# URGENT: Wallet Recovery - 3.2 SOL Locked Due to Data Corruption

## Problem Summary
My Solana wallet contains 3.2 SOL but is completely locked due to data corruption. All transfer attempts fail with the same error.

## Wallet Details
- **Address**: `4MpnddXrsYGzCv6GBe6y39DWLpixqiTjW5nEpbaXffrq`
- **Balance**: 3.227472136 SOL
- **Owner**: System Program (`11111111111111111111111111111111`)
- **Data Size**: 80 bytes attached to account

## Error Details
Every transfer attempt fails with:
```
InstructionError: [ 0, 'InvalidArgument' ]
Logs: "Transfer: `from` must not carry data"
```

## What I've Tried
1. **Multiple RPC endpoints**: Helius, official Solana, Project Serum
2. **All amounts**: From 0.0001 SOL to full balance
3. **Different methods**: 
   - `sendAndConfirmTransaction`
   - `sendRawTransaction` with `skipPreflight: true`
   - Multiple retries and timeouts
4. **Transaction variations**: Different blockhashes, fee payers, commitments

## Code Attempts
```javascript
// All these fail with the same error
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: keypair.publicKey,
    toPubkey: destinationPubkey,
    lamports: amount
  })
);
```

## Current Status
- Wallet is completely unusable for transfers
- 3.2 SOL is effectively locked
- Private key is available for recovery
- Account belongs to System Program (not a custom program)

## Request
I need urgent assistance to recover these funds. This appears to be a rare edge case where a System Program account has data attached that prevents all SOL transfers.

## Contact Information
- I can provide private key if needed for recovery
- Available for immediate assistance
- This is blocking significant funds

Thank you for any help you can provide.
